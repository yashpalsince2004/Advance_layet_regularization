## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### ✅ 1. **Advanced Layers in TensorFlow**
- `Lambda` Layers
- Custom Layers using `tf.keras.layers.Layer`
- Functional API for flexible model design

### ✅ 2. **Regularization Techniques**
- `L1`, `L2`, and `L1_L2` regularization
- `Dropout` layer usage and tuning
- Avoiding overfitting in deep models

### ✅ 3. **Model Evaluation**
- Plotting training vs validation loss
- Visualizing model predictions
- Identifying underfitting and overfitting scenarios

### ✅ 4. **TensorFlow Lite Conversion**
- Exporting trained model to `.tflite`
- Converting Keras model using `TFLiteConverter`
- Saving the `.tflite` file for mobile and embedded usage
